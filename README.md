# book-search-engine

## Description

This application is a book search engine using Google. The user can create an account and from there search for books. Once searched, the user can select to save specific books to their account. The books can be viewed on a saved books page, and from there the user can delete the book if desired. This version of the project was modified from a starter code in order to utilize GraphQL instead of RESTful APIs as well as using Apollo Provider as middleware. This application also uses JWT as the form of authentication.
